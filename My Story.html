            <h2>Page 1: The Beginning</h2>
            <p>Once Upon a Time…
There was a crow who lived in a forest close to a town. The crow was travelling for a long time so he was very thirsty. He looked around for water to drink, but was unable to find any water source.
                
                The crow started feeling weak because there was no water. He started searching for water. He flew all around the jungle and in the nearby town. After travelling around the town, the crow saw a house and thought there must be water in the house.


After reaching the house, he saw a pot full of water. He became very happy. But, now the problem was that the water level in the pot was very low and the crow was unable to drink water from the pot.


The crow thought a lot and an idea came across his mind. He thought, “If I throw some pebbles in the pot then the water present in the pot will go up and I will be able to drink water easily.”
